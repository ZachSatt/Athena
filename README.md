# Athena
Athena is a ArtMusic app. The purpose of the app is to spark a greater interest in art. The app randomly plays music of the users genre choice and plays it alongside the images pulled up. The images are taken from the Harvard Museum API and the music is played from the searched info on the Ddeezer Music API. The styling of the app and pages are all simple yet eye catching, all set up to make you want to experience this app. The intention was to get users to be curious, excited, intrigued as to what art can make them feel, see, and recall.

API based museum curated images w/ music.
